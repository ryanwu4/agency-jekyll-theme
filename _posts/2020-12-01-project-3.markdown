description: Using R, I analyzed data from Ricardo WAVE simulations of the Columbia Formula Racing engine to optimize power and torque curves for maximum track performance. I also used Mathematica to maximize acoustic suppression for the Helmholtz resonator on the exhaust of the engine, ensuring manufacturability and modularity.
