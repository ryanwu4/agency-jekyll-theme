description: Coordinating with a team of 4 researchers, I implemented an independent project which leveraged machine learning-based satellite remote sensing data acquisition and reduction using R and ArcGIS to determine how drought and heat stress affects forest health. For my research, I was named a Regeneron Science Talent Search Scholar and the work will be included in an upcoming publication.
