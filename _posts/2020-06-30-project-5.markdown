description: I managed a global team of 30+ volunteers to coordinate delivery of over 2000 pounds of plastic feedstock and 100k+ face shields between manufacturers, makerspaces, and hospitals within the NYC area and in Liberia, India, and Europe, providing critical PPE to frontline workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. To organize the effort, I processed data using R from 5000 makerspaces and independent volunteers to create a database of available fabrication tools for rapid mobilization of distributed PPE production.
