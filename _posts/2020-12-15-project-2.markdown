description: As part of a team of 11 students, I designed Entry, Descent and Landing as well as Guidance and Navigation for a hypothetical $400M Enceladus lander mission using Siemens NX and contributed to the preliminary design review. As deputy project manager, I also facilitated role division and ensured team participation in the project for on-time deliverables. In workshops for the Mission Concept Academy, we also learned about the NASA mission planning process and engineering design principles.
